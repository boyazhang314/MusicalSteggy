## About
Musical Steggy is a web app that performs music steganography, hiding text in music. The entered text is transformed into musical notes that accompany the lullaby "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star". [Here](https://www.soundslice.com/slices/vmRkc/) is an example of what "hello" could sound like.
